[Known issues]

Mono 2.2 and 2.4 cannot compile this release (bug report: https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=488960). Please compile with Mono 2.0 or 2.4.2+, or use the precompiled binaries.

OpenTK.Graphics.TextPrinter fails to render text with newlines or a layout rectangle on Mono. This is a Mono GDI+ bug.

Example documentation may not show up correctly when running on Mono.


[API changes]

Please note that binary compatibility is not preserved between beta releases.

OpenTK 0.9.8 replaces several instances of the "All" and "Version*" enums with strongly-typed equivalents. This is a breaking change. If you are affected by this change, replace these enums with the ones suggested by your compiler.

OpenTK 0.9.8 removes several OpenGL overloads that take arrays of a single item. This is a breaking change. If you are affected by this change, please use the 'ref' or 'out' overload for the relevant function.

OpenTK 0.9.8 removes or replaces several invalid tokens in the DrawBuffer(s) methods. This is a breaking change.
