#                       OpenTK 0.9.1 Alpha Release notes                        #
#################################################################################

IMPORTANT: This release is intended for testing and experimentation only. Use at
your own risk!
           
0.9.1 contains updates to OpenAL (EFX/EAX extensions, AudioContext) and OpenGL
(enums for FBOs and multiple GraphicsContexts). Resolution changes and fullscreen
modes are now supported, and work has begun on a native Mac OS X port. Many long-
standing bugs have been fixed, and last, but not least, new OpenAL and GLSL
examples have been added to the Example launcher - don't forget to check these
out!

See below for the full changelog, in case you are interested, as well as the
porting guidelines below (there are several breaking changes, but all are
thankfully simple to fix).

This release marks the third development milestone (fullscreen support). One
missing feature, Joystick support, left to enter beta state.

Don't forget to visit our homepage at http://www.opentk.com for the latest
developments.

Till next time!
 - Stephen A.

#                            Porting from 0.9.0                                 #
#################################################################################

Updating to Mono 1.2.6 is strongly recommended

To facilitate future development (e.g. OpenGL 3 support), some namespaces and
class names have been altered. Please, run the following project-wide search and
replace operations:
1. "GLContext"     -> "GraphicsContext"
2. "OpenTK.OpenGL" -> "OpenTK.Graphics"
3. "OpenTK.OpenAL" -> "OpenTK.Audio"
4. "GL.ReadPixel"  -> "GL.ReadPixels"

The "DisplayMode" class has been marked as obsolete. Its functionality has been
split into two classes: "DisplayResolution" and "GraphicsMode". This is mostly
an internal change and should only affect your GameWindow constructor (a 1-line
change to fix the warning).

The "ColorMode" class has been moved to "OpenTK.Graphics.ColorDepth"; please,
replace references with the latter.

Alc and Alut will be removed in future versions. Please use
OpenTK.Audio.AudioContext and OpenTK.Audio.AudioReader instead.

 * Feature: EFX/EAX/XRAM OpenAL extensions.
 * Feature: AudioContext class to create and use OpenAL contexts.
 * Feature: AudioReader class to load audio resources. Wav/PCM formats are
            supported, while Ogg support will be added in the future.
 * Feature: Enumerate and change resolutions through DisplayDevice and
            DisplayResolution.
 * Feature: GameWindow Fullscreen support.
 * Feature: GameWindow borders can be made fixed or hidden.
 * Feature: VSync support under Linux.
 * Feature: Improved mode selection for OpenGL contexts.
 * Feature: Improved handling of multiple GraphicsContexts and resource sharing.
 * Feature: Improved Frame Buffer Objects (FBO) API.
 * Feature: New GLSL example (Julia Set).
 * Feature: New OpenAL example (Playback).
 * Feature: New Tests (Input Logger, GameWindow States, Resolutions).
 
 * Fix: Improved adaptive VSync behavior in low-fps situtations.
 * Fix: Mouse movement deltas are correctly reported now.
 * Fix: Matrix4.Frustum was invalid for skewed matrices.
 * Fix (Windows): Mouse cursor no longer remains in an invalid state when
                  entering a GameWindow.

 * Known issue: Many font layout options are not implemented.
 * Known issue: Some commandline arguments in "Bind" do not work.
 * Known issue: Audio may crack or even crash when using the obsolete Sample
                Implementation. Upgrade to OpenAL Soft to fix this issue.
 * Known issue: Fonts are not snapped to the pixel grid and may look blurry.
 * Known issue (Linux): OpenTK may segfault while loading, on some Xorg/video
                        driver combinations. This is known to occur on fglrx
                        7.10-8.4.
