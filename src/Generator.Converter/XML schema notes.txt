Notes

Functions:
 - [function name] should not contain a prefix, i.e. BufferData instead of glBufferData.
 - [extension] must be set to "Core" if this is not an extension method. Otherwise, it must be set to extension name in CamelCase. For example, method MapBufferOES should set extension="Oes".
 - [profile name] can be used to discriminate between different profiles of the same spec (for example "full" and "lite" for ES1.1). This attribute is not used at this point.
 - [category] should be set to the correct function category. This is typically defined for extension methods (e.g.  TexImage3DOES belongs to category GL_OES_texture_3D). If the category is unknown, this should be set to the same value as the "version" attribute below.
 - [version] must be set to the correct spec version. OpenGL|ES and OpenCL distribute different header files for each spec version, so this can be set to a constant value (e.g. 1.0 for ES1.0). On the other hand, OpenGL and OpenAL distribute a single file that contains functions from all versions.
 
The extension attribute is used by the generator to distinguish between core and extension methods (the first use plain DllImports, while the latter are only converted to delegates).
 
The category and version attributes are used by the generator to match enum parameters. An enum parameter may either define an exact type or may be a generic enum (GLenum). In the last case, category and version are used to find a matching enum. If no match exists, the enum "All" will be used.
 
Parameter typenames are translated to C# as follows: [typename] -> gl.tm -> csharp.tm. The gl.tm typemap file is shipped by Khronos and matches GL types to C types (this file should not be edited). The csharp.tm typemap file is handwritten and maps C types to C# types (this file may be edited).

Typenames that resolve to csharp strings or string arrays are treated specially by the generator for the purposes of marshalling. For this reason, byte* parameters that contain ASCII strings should be overriden by char* or CharPointer parameters.
 

Enums:
  - [enum name] should be a valid C# enum name in CamelCase.
  - [token name] should be a valid C# enum token in ALL_CAPS. The generator will translate this to camel case.
  - [enum value] may be a hex or dec number, or a string that refers to a different enum token. The generator will recursively resolve token references and will parse the final values to ensure they are well-formed numbers.
