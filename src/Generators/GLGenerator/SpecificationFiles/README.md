This folder contains the gl spec and related documentation files.

The generator will download these files if they are missing, this is also the mechanism used to update these files.

To update the gl specification, delete `gl.xml`.

To update the documentation, delete one or all of the `es1.1/`, `es3/`, `gl2.1/`, `gl4/` folders.
