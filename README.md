The Open Toolkit library is a fast, low-level C# binding for OpenGL, OpenGL ES, OpenAL, and OpenCL. It runs on all major platforms and powers hundreds of apps, games and scientific research.

Use OpenTK to add cross-platform 3d graphics, audio, compute and haptics to your C# application. Integrate it into your existing user interface or use it standalone without any external dependencies.

OpenTK comes with simple and easy to follow tutorials for learning *modern* OpenGL. These are written by the community and represent all of the best practices to get you started.

Features
========

- Create cutting-edge graphics with OpenGL 4.6 and OpenGL ES 3.0
- Spice up your GUI with 3d acceleration
- Improve your code flow with strong types and inline documentation
- Windowing systems to help get you started
- Input, and other game essentials.
- Performant, highly optimized and reliable linear algebra library
- Write once run everywhere

OpenTK is available for Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, *BSD and SteamOS. It can be used standalone or integrated into a GUI (Windows.Forms, WPF, GTK+, Qt, VTK, ...)

An old, unsupported version of OpenTK 1.0 may be included in the [Xamarin](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/graphics-games/game-development/) Android and iOS distribution. The Xamarin fork is not supported or maintained by this project.

Adding support for mobile again is a future goal of the OpenTK project, but is somewhat frustrated by Apple's deprecation of OpenGL. Contributions to re-add support for these platforms are welcomed.

Instructions
============

OpenTK is available as a [NuGet Package](http://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenTK/).

OpenTK 4 running on Windows requires "Visual C++ Redistributable 2015" to be installed to run.
See https://github.com/opentk/glfw-redist for more details.
