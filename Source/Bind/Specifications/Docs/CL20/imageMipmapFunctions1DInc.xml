    <para>
        For the forms that take an <type>image1d_t</type> object, 
        use the coordinate <emphasis>coord</emphasis> to 
        do an element lookup in the mip-level specified by  
        <varname>lod</varname> in the 1D image object specified 
        by <varname>image</varname>.
    </para>

    <para>
        For the forms that use gradients, use the gradients to compute 
        the lod and coordinate <emphasis>coord</emphasis> to do an 
        element lookup in
        the mip-level specified by the computed lod in
        the 1D image object specified by <varname>image</varname>.
    </para>

    <para>
        For the forms that take an <type>image1d_array_t</type> object, 
        use the coordinate <emphasis>coord.x</emphasis> to 
        do an element lookup in the 1D image identified by 
        <emphasis>coord.x</emphasis> and mip-level specified by  
        <varname>lod</varname> in the 1D image object specified 
        by <varname>image</varname>.
    </para>

    <para>
        When a multisample image is accessed in a kernel, 
        the access takes one vector of 
        integers describing which pixel to fetch and an 
        integer corresponding to the sample numbers 
        describing which sample within the pixel to fetch. 
        sample identifies the sample position in the 
        multi-sample image.
    </para>

    <para>
        For best performance, we recommend that <varname>sample</varname> 
        be a literal value so it is known at 
        compile time and the OpenCL compiler can perform appropriate 
        optimizationsfor multisample reads on the device.
