OpenTK.OpenGL.Bind 0.9.3

0.7.7 -> 0.9.3
+ Synced code with Tao.GlBindGen
+ Re-enabled extensions
+ Updated specs
+ Now uses CodeDOM for code generation
+ Imports and delegates are decorated with the SupressUnmanagedCodeSecurity attribute for call overhead reduction
+ Several bugs have been fixed


0.7.6 -> 0.7.7
+ Several bugfixes regarding bugs from the latest (0.7.6) code synchronisation between Tao.GlBindGen and OpenTK.OpenGL.Bind
+ Split the Enums, Core OpenGL and Extension OpenGL functions into different files. This speeds up the Visual Studio IDE a lot.
+ The Extension functions have been removed from the OpenTK.OpenGL.GL class. They will be added back on a later version, probably as OpenTK.OpenGL.GL.Extensions. No need to clatter up the code API with thousands of mostly useless extensions.
	+ Applications load much faster now.
+ Killed the Context class generation. It added a lot of complexity for little gain (what, cleaner OOP internal structure? Oh, please!) This move frees up the Context classes which can now be updated without dragging around several thousand function initialisations.
	+ OpenTK.OpenGL.GL is self-contained now. Delegates are initialised statically, calling the platform specific *GetAddress functions where needed (they are contained in the GL class, too - but not auto-generated).
+ Revamped the WriteSpecs class. Its methods are now completely modular (enum, core and extension writers have been split).
	+ This still needs some refactoring to reduce code copy-paste and allow for future wgl / glx binding generation.


0.7.5.2 -> 0.7.6
+ Added NeedWrapper and WrapperType properties to each parameter (needed for more fine grained control on wrapper generation).
+ Added Function, Parameter, ParameterCollection (deep) copy constructors. This allows simpler code in many places (since we can now create new Functions without fear of affecting the old ones, for example).
+ Merged the ParameterCollection.cs with Parameter.cs
+ Added the FunctionBody class which contains the contents of a function as a list of strings. It is mainly intended for wrappers (allows cleaner code, too).
+ The wrapper generation now happens in TranlateSpecs.cs instead of WriteSpecs.cs. (Translations and generations should only happen during the translation phase, not while reading or writing. Allow for cleaner code).
+ Revamped the wrapper generator code. Now it handles correctly the cases where a function has more than one parameter that needs wrapping (i.e. it generates all permutations correctly). This is handled by recursively generating the needed permutations (it was a hell to implement).
+ Added some comments (many more to follow).
+ Removed some commented-out regions and some obsolete functions.


0.7.5.1 -> 0.7.5.2
+ Added translation for out char[] parameters (they are treated as StringBuilders, as specified in MSDN).
+ Added System.Text using directive.


0.7.5 -> 0.7.5.1
+ Added license information to the generated bindings.
+ Changed the name of the main Context class to GLContext (Context is used in the BCL).


0.7.4 -> 0.7.5
+ Added wrappers for all functions that accept arrays. Permitted parameters for these are: an array of the original type (e.g. float[]), an IntPtr (if you manage memory yourself), or any blittable type (e.g. float[,,]). No type checking is done in the last case, so be careful!
+ Updated the wrappers for all functions that accept or return void pointers. Permitted parameters for these are: an IntPtr or any blittable type (type checking is turned off, so be extra careful!)
+ Aliased the GLbool type to int. It is hacky, but the examples bundled with Tao rely on this...
+ Added a wrapper for glLineStipple. Now you can pass an int to it, but only the last 16 bits will be used for the stipple (as per the function specification). This was the only way to avoid aliasing the parameter to ushort (non-CLS compatible) or having the user write unchecked((short)0x....) every time he used the function.
+ Added the WrapperType enum. Every function has a Property that indicates the wrapper it will need. This cleans up the WriteWrappers function somewhat.
+ Added the PreviousType property to the Function class. This is used when generating wrappers for functions with type-checked arrays (e.g. float[] arrays etc).
+ Corrected some type aliases in cs_types.txt
+ Added the missing wrappers for glReadPixels! (this falls in the out void array).
+ A missing enum now defaults to Enum.[Function category] (a new property was added to the Function class and the SpecReader.ReadFunctions function was modified). I should test this to see if it works ok.
