About the C# Wrapper
--------------------
The C# wrapper was written to be used for MonoGame's desktop platforms. However,
this is written in a way that can be used for any general C# application.

The wrapper provides bindings for the following libraries:
- SDL2
- SDL2_image
- SDL2_mixer
- SDL2_ttf

We also provide bindings for OpenGL and OpenAL, taken from OpenTK.

Note that SDL2# will not provide every single SDL2 function. This is due to
limitations in the C# language that would cause major conflicts with the native
SDL2 library and its extensions.

SDL2# is a pure port of the C headers. The naming schemes for this library will
be exactly as they are done in the C library, with little-to-no concern for
"appropriate" C# style. The namespace indicates that this is SDL2, the class
names will indicate which library file the function/type/value exists in, and
everything else will be as close to the C version as technically possible.
