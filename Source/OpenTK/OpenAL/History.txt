Version History:
 
0.1 Initial
- Tokens AL_TRUE and AL_FALSE removed, created new type. see AL.Bool
  Tokens ALC_TRUE and ALC_FALSE removed, created new type. see AL.Bool
- Added AL.Null for convenience when working with C Manuals.  
- Alut: The following functions are not bound/imported. Issue of undoing C malloc to prevent memory leaks.
        "alutLoadMemoryFromFile, alutLoadMemoryFromFileImage, alutLoadMemoryHelloWorld, alutLoadMemoryWaveform"
  Please use Alut.CreateBuffer* functions instead, which have similar functionality and return a Buffer Handle instead.
- AL: Functions not imported:
      alListeneri, alListener3i, alListeneriv
      alGetListeneri, alGetListener3i, alGetListeneriv
      alGetBooleanv, alGetIntegerv, alGetFloatv, alGetDoublev 
      imported, but currently disabled: alGetBoolean, alGetDouble
      alBufferf, alBufferfv, alBufferi, alBuffer3i, alBufferiv
      imported, but currently disabled: alBuffer3f
      alGetBufferf, alGetBuffer3f, alGetBufferfv, alGetBuffer3i, alGetBufferiv

0.2
- Largely improved documentation, found homes for previously orphaned Tokens.
- The Token AL_DATA is hidden now, as it returns a pointer to unmanaged memory
   where the buffer was located previously to calling AL.BufferData(). (It is usually freed after buffering)
- Added Function AL.GetErrorString()
- Added overloads for requesting/deleting a single buffer/source at a time.
- Added Vector3 overloads where applicable.

0.3 - breaks former written examples.
- Using a single changelog now, as the number of issues per file has significantly shrunk.
- Refactored -i -fv -3f functions to be overloads e.g AL.GetSource, AL.GetListener
- Added XRam Extension prototype. Untested, as it requires special hardware.
- Refactored extensively to match OpenTK naming conventions.
- Moved functions into overloads
- Removed all C prototype comments from AL/ALC/ALUT
- Documented Alc properly

0.4
- changed Alc enum GetString/GetStringList
- disabled Alut.Sleep, rather use Thread.Sleep
- DopplerVelocity, ChannelMask  are deprecated and marked.
- functions with ushort, uint, ulong marked 

0.5 vanilla complete
- Fix Alc.GetString( Enums.AlcGetStringList ) to terminate with 2 null, and split at 1 null

Next Version:
- EFX Extension 
- Enums themselves require summaries (do EFX 1st)
