The total number of work-items in a work-group is computed as local_work_size[0] *... * local_work_size[work_dim - 1]. The total number of work-items in the work-group must be less than or equal to the DeviceMaxWorkGroupSize value specified in table of OpenCL Device Queries for clGetDeviceInfo and the number of work-items specified in local_work_size[0],... local_work_size[work_dim - 1] must be less than or equal to the corresponding values specified by DeviceMaxWorkItemSizes[0],.... DeviceMaxWorkItemSizes[work_dim - 1].  The explicitly specified local_work_size will be used to determine how to break the global work-items specified by global_work_size into appropriate work-group instances. The values in local_work_size need not evenly divide the global_work_size in any dimension. In this case, any single dimension for which the global size is not divisible by the local size will be partitioned into two regions. One region will have workgroups that have the same number of work items as was specified by the local size parameter in that dimension. The other region will have work-groups with less than the number of work items specified by the local size parameter in that dimension. The global IDs and group IDs of the work items in the first region will be numerically lower than those in the second, and the second region will be at most one work-group wide in that dimension. Workgroup sizes could be non-uniform in multiple dimensions, potentially producing work-groups of up to 4 different sizes in a 2D range and 8 different sizes in a 3D range.  If local_work_size is NULL, the OpenCL runtime is free to implement the ND-range using uniform or non-uniform work-group sizes, regardless of the divisibility of the global work size. If the ND-range is implemented using non-uniform work-group sizes, the work-group sizes, global IDs and group IDs will follow the same pattern as described in above paragraph.  The work-group size to be used for kernel can also be specified in the program source using the __attribute__ ((reqd_work_group_size(X, Y, Z))) qualifier. In this case the size of work group specified by local_work_size must match the value specified by the reqd_work_group_size__attribute__ qualifier.  These work-group instances are executed in parallel across multiple compute units or concurrently on the same compute unit.  Each work-item is uniquely identified by a global identifier. The global ID, which can be read inside the kernel, is computed using the value given by global_work_size and global_work_offset. In addition, a work-item is also identified within a work-group by a unique local ID. The local ID, which can also be read by the kernel, is computed using the value given by local_work_size. The starting local ID is always (0, 0, ... 0).

The explicitly specified local_work_size will be used to determine how to break the global work-items specified by global_work_size into appropriate work-group instances. The values in local_work_size need not evenly divide the global_work_size in any dimension. In this case, any single dimension for which the global size is not divisible by the local size will be partitioned into two regions. One region will have workgroups that have the same number of work items as was specified by the local size parameter in that dimension. The other region will have work-groups with less than the number of work items specified by the local size parameter in that dimension.

If local_work_size is NULL, the OpenCL runtime is free to implement the ND-range using uniform or non-uniform work-group sizes, regardless of the divisibility of the global work size. If the ND-range is implemented using non-uniform work-group sizes, the work-group sizes, global IDs and group IDs will follow the same pattern as described in above paragraph.  The work-group size to be used for kernel can also be specified in the program source using the __attribute__ ((reqd_work_group_size(X, Y, Z))) qualifier. In this case the size of work group specified by local_work_size must match the value specified by the reqd_work_group_size__attribute__ qualifier.  These work-group instances are executed in parallel across multiple compute units or concurrently on the same compute unit.  Each work-item is uniquely identified by a global identifier. The global ID, which can be read inside the kernel, is computed using the value given by global_work_size and global_work_offset. In addition, a work-item is also identified within a work-group by a unique local ID. The local ID, which can also be read by the kernel, is computed using the value given by local_work_size.

If blocking_write is True the OpenCL implementation copies the data referred to by ptr and enqueues the write command in the command-queue. The memory pointed to by ptr can be reused by the application after the clEnqueueWriteImage call returns.  If blocking_write is False the OpenCL implementation will use ptr to perform a nonblocking write. As the write is non-blocking the implementation can return immediately. The memory pointed to by ptr cannot be reused by the application after the call returns. The event argument returns an event object which can be used to query the execution status of the write command. When the write command has completed, the memory pointed to by ptr can then be reused by the application.
