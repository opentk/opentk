KernelWorkGroupSizesize_t This provides a mechanism for the application to query the maximum work-group size that can be used to execute a kernel on a specific device given by device. The OpenCL implementation uses the resource requirements of the kernel (register usage etc.) to determine what this work-group size should be. KernelCompile workGroupSizesize_t[3] Returns the work-group size specified by the Attribute((reqdWorkGroupSize(x, y, z))) qualifier. See Function Qualifiers. If the work-group size is not specified using the above attribute qualifier (0, 0, 0) is returned. KernelLocalMemSizecl_ulong Returns the amount of local memory in bytes being used by a kernel. This includes local memory that may be needed by an implementation to execute the kernel, variables declared inside the kernel with the __local address qualifier and local memory to be allocated for arguments to the kernel declared as pointers with the __local address qualifier and whose size is specified with clSetKernelArg.  If the local memory size, for any pointer argument to the kernel declared with the __local address qualifier, is not specified, its size is assumed to be 0. KernelPreferredWork groupSizeMultiplesize_t Returns the preferred multiple of workgroup size for launch. This is a performance hint. Specifying a workgroup size that is not a multiple of the value returned by this query as the value of the local work size argument to clEnqueueNDRangeKernelwill not fail to enqueue the kernel for execution unless the work-group size specified is larger than the device maximum. KernelPrivateMemSizecl_ulong Returns the minimum amount of private memory, in bytes, used by each workitem in the kernel. This value may include any private memory needed by an implementation to execute the kernel, including that used by the language built-ins and variable declared inside the kernel with the __private qualifier.
